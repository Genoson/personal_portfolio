            Hi! I'm Stephen Squire a student at Keyin College currently enrolled
            in my second semester of the Software Development program. I have
            always had an affinity for technology and computers. I spend a lot
            of time reading about the newest breakthroughs in hardware and
            software. My hobbies include cooking (I worked as a chef prior to
            starting this program) , gaming, and hanging out with my cats and
            dog.

            My love affair with technology started young, I was always into the
            science fiction shows, books, and movies growing up. Be that the
            Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Donatello was my favourite), Star
            Wars, Star Trek, the Alien franchise, and The Matrix to name a few.
            I always found myself fascinated by the fictional science and
            technology of the worlds portrayed in these works and often wondered
            where the line between science fiction, science future, and science
            fact lay.

          <p className="leftAlign">
            Fast forward to my early twenties and I was enrolled in Memorial
            University taking a little bit of all the sciences and maths but not
            having any direction besides a general lust for understanding. I
            dropped out of school and kinda bummed around between jobs before
            landing in a professional kitchen. The hook was set and I spent the
            rest of my twenties and early 30's mastering the skills required to
            excel in a restaurants kitchen, eventually becoming the head chef of
            a place and writing a menu, training staff and overseeing the
            minutia of keeping a restaurant profitable. This was no longer the
            job I had fallen in love with at this point.
          </p>
          <p className="leftAlign">
            The Covid-19 pandemic struck right as I was becoming jaded with the
            lifestyle of being a chef, shutting down restaurants the world over
            and giving me ample time to do some soul searching. On one such
            evening sitting around at home, doom scrolling my technology centric
            newsfeed, I stumbled upon the "Flippy" robot by Miso Robotics. This
            little robotic arm was flipping burgers and cooking fries and coming
            for the entry level jobs in the restaurant industry, like robots had
            in so many before it. This got me thinking about how I needed to get
            on the right side of this revolution in automation. Not long after I
            heard of this program at Keyin and the rest is history.

          My Motivations and Goals
          <hr />
        </h3>

        <article class="two">
          <p>
            As mentioned in the precious section, my journey into this field has
            taken a lifetime to get started. On the bright side, I have a
            lifetime of looking in on the field as a passionate hobbyist to
            guide my decisions as a travel deeper into the rabbit hole of
            software development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Coming into this program at Keyin I had no idea what to expect or
            where it would take me. I honestly still don't, but I am beginning
            to form an idea of where I'd like to end up and what I'd like to be
            doing when I get there. Across the rest of this section I hope to
            lay bare my thought process in narrowing my sights.
          </p>
          <p>
            First off, I knew when I started that I wanted to work in a creative
            role. That was my favourite part of being a chef and there are a lot
            of similarities between the creation process of writing and refining
            a new recipe for a professional kitchen and that of writing a piece
            of software. Knowing what you want to create is only the beginning
            of the process in both cases, the real meat of the work lies in
            identifying the ingredients and procedures needed to get there. As
            well as then refining the product to be more efficient and the
            recipe to be easy for colleagues to read and reproduce.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, I know that I want to work with code at the cutting edge
            of whichever field I find myself in. Be that web design as we are
            studying this semester or machine learning and deep learning
            applications that are already all around us revolutionizing how we
            work, shop, eat, and play. This desire to be at the forefront of
            innovation will ensure this career path is one of lifelong learning.
            Which is the point of this, my desire to be constantly learning and
            challenged to grow my skillset meshes quite well with the
            expectations of being a software developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, building a strong foundation of skills like those offered
            in this program at Keyin in a currated and employment focused
            manner, rather than the purely academic studies I had previously
            attempted, is much more in line with how I am able to motivate
            myself to learn. Having a why from the perspective of the industry I
            am heading into for each skill really puts the importance of it all
            into focus.

          What's Hot in Tech Today, My Hot Take
          <hr />
        </h3>
        <article  class="one">
          <p>
            As an avid follower of the technology sector I have been keeping up
            on all the news in a variety of fields of interest of mine and hope
            to be able to shed some light on to them to you here.
          </p>
          <p>
            A major trend in technology today is the electrification of our
            transportation network. Be that Tesla with their electric and self
            driving cars or Ford with it's new Lightning F-150. Also, many major
            retailers, such as Canadian Tire, have committed to electrifying
            their transport truck fleet. Eventually shifting the entire trucking
            industry to a self driving electric model. On the smaller scale
            Amazon has delivery drones in many cities. All these things will be
            running software of some sort and will require skilled software
            technitiens to develop and maintain them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another major trend is in machine learning leveraging new types of
            software and hardware to offload tasks that previously only a human
            could perform. Facial recognition, voice recognition, self driving
            cars, and the photo software on our cell phones all utilize some
            level of this technology. It is also being used to study and derive
            useful information from very large datasets. We are all familiar
            with facebook and google advertisements being specifically honed
            into each of us individually. This point in particular also has a
            large body of debate ongoing about the ethics of using machines for
            these tasks. Does a piece of software that sorts resumes for an
            accounting firm have any bias' baked into it's code? Should we
            develop technologies that could be used to discriminate? How do we
            write code that avoids these issues. There is so much more to this
            topic but I shouldn't get too into it here.
          </p>
          <p>
            This point is smaller in scope than the previous two. Literally.
            Cell phones and tablets have dramatically shifted how digital
            content is consumed. With this change how digital content is made
            has been forced to shift as well. Today a website for a business is
            all but useless if it hasn't been designed with these smaller
            devices in mind. As such, modern web development practices that
            include a wide array of compatibility with all sorts of devices is
            needed at all levels of web development. Coupled to this point is
            the shift of consumer habits towards online marketplaces. This small
            screen revolution needs a big workforce of software developers that
            use the most up to date standards of web design.
          </p>
          <p>
            My final point in this section is important across all my previously
            mentioned topics. Security. As more and more of our activities
            become driven by technology, a security vulnerability in software
            can be very distruptive. Having an insecure and outdated piece of
            tech anywhere in the daisy chain of devices we now trust with all of
            our personal data could lead to any number of problems. Identity
            theft can happen to any one of us and we may never even know how it
            happened. Industries have been taken hostage by maliscious code
            getting into factories or power plants and businesses have been
            shuttered over damages caused by mishandling sensitive data.
            Learning how to write secure code is essential and updating old code
            to new security standards is a constantly evolving field with lots
            of opportunity.
